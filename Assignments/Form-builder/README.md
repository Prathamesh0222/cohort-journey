# Form Builder

This project is a dynamic Form Builder built with React, allowing users to create forms with different field types (`text`, `checkbox`, `radio`). The form fields can be added dynamically, and for `radio` fields, multiple options can be specified.

## Features

- **Dynamic Field Addition**: Users can add fields by specifying a field label and field type (`text`, `checkbox`, or `radio`).
- **Radio Button Options**: Users can provide multiple options for radio button fields.
- **Form Preview**: The added fields are previewed in real-time on the form preview section.
- **Field Validation**: Each field requires a label to be entered before it can be added.
  
## Field Types Supported

1. **Text Input**: A simple text field for user input.
2. **Checkbox**: A checkbox that can be checked/unchecked.
3. **Radio Button**: A group of radio buttons with user-defined options.
